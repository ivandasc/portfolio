## Projects

### 1. [Analysis Report for Fraud Prevention Project](https://anaconda.cloud/share/notebooks/a60964b4-1e11-40cc-a6fb-2f3af0da574a/preview)
![Analysis Report for Fraud Prevention Project](https://cdn.glitch.global/620be249-566e-4d25-b77c-d9f456db7a1c/5b15e478-f79d-4f12-9d2b-3da35390d1a1.image.png?v=1720985534530)
This project performs an exploratory analysis of the `creditcard.csv` dataset to detect patterns of fraudulent activities in financial transactions. The analysis includes class distribution, variable correlation, outlier analysis, and visualizations such as histograms and 3D plots. Conclusions suggest using advanced machine learning techniques to improve fraud detection, given the non-linear characteristics and class imbalance in the data.

### 2. [Impact of Plastic Waste in Florianópolis and the World: Exploring the Boundaries between Local and Global](https://anaconda.cloud/share/notebooks/c448f29b-ea91-47fb-a969-1d663a79b071/preview)
![Impact of Plastic Waste](https://cdn.glitch.global/620be249-566e-4d25-b77c-d9f456db7a1c/a2fabb7b-26ec-4466-b277-d201b54ae98f.image.png?v=1721212679321)
This project investigates the improper disposal of plastic waste, focusing on PET bottles, in Florianópolis and compares it with national and global data. Using real data, interactive graphs, and 3D visualizations, we aim to understand the problem's magnitude and propose solutions to reduce environmental impact.

### 3. [Popularity of Python, Java, and C++ over Time](https://anaconda.cloud/share/notebooks/a2a8b718-7053-4720-a8f5-d154d5ef06f0/preview)
![Popularity of Programming Languages](https://cdn.glitch.global/620be249-566e-4d25-b77c-d9f456db7a1c/df259b12-13b4-45b5-910b-e2f169067edc.image.png?v=1721231715411)
This project analyzes the popularity trends of Python, Java, and C++ from April 2019 to April 2024. By examining the `trend_over_time` dataset, the analysis provides insights into the long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and the most popular language during different periods.
